How to use gitignore
gitignore is used to prevent the adding and commiting the unwanted files into the repo.
Inoreder to do that we create a .gitignore file in the root directory of the repo.
 For example ~/git_comp is my repo.
 Now create a .gitconfig file
 Add *~ which ignores all the files ending with ~.
 Similiatly we can do the same for files and even folders.

This usuallu works for files which are not previuosly commited.
